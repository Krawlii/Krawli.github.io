	<h4 class="it-supp-header">IT Support</h4>
       I provide front-line technical support to ensure smooth and uninterrupted operations within organizations.
  My responsibilities include diagnosing hardware and software issues, setting up workstations, maintaining system security, and assisting users in resolving technical problems.
  I take pride in delivering timely solutions, clear communication, and proactive system checks to prevent downtime.<br><br>
  Whether it's solving a sudden connectivity issue or guiding a colleague through software installation, I make sure every user feels supported and confident in their tech environment.
  IT support is more than fixing things‚Äîit's about creating a reliable experience for everyone.

	 <h4 class="trader-header">TRADER</h4>
      Trading is one of my greatest passions, where I apply my analytical skills to the Forex market. I analyze charts, track price movements, and identify patterns to make informed decisions.
    As a Forex trader, I constantly evaluate risk and rewards, making disciplined decisions in a fast-paced environment. It‚Äôs not just about making profits ‚Äî it's about staying grounded, following a structured strategy, and continuously learning.<br><br>
    In addition to trading, I am part of a growing community of traders where we share strategies, knowledge, and support. We encourage each other, celebrate wins, and learn from mistakes, helping everyone improve their trading skills.
    Forex trading requires a combination of patience, adaptability, and mental strength, and it's these qualities that make it such a fulfilling journey for me.
